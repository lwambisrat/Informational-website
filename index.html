                        To update your inventory and monitor stock levels, log in to your dashboard and navigate to the
                        "Products" section. Here, you’ll see a list of all products along with their current stock
                        quantities. You can manually adjust stock numbers, add new products, or mark items as out of

                        stockouts.
